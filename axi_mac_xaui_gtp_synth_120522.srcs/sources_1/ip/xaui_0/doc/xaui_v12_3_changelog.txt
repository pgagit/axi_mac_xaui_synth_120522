2014.4.1:
 * Version 12.1 (Rev. 4)
 * No changes

2014.4:
 * Version 12.1 (Rev. 4)
 * Added support for 7-Series Defense-grade, Automotive, and Low Voltage parts
 * Edited the example design demonstration testbench to monitor the mgt_tx_ready signal before beginning MDIO accesses (previously the testbench waited for a fixed duration which was sometimes overly conservative)
 * Added a clock domain crossing synchronizer to signal_detect.
 * Tidied up whitespace in HDL files for better alignment and indent consistency
 * When the transceiver Rx PRBS functionality is enabled through the optional transceiver control and status ports, periodic transceiver RX resets due to lack of lane synchronization are inhibited
 * Encrypted source files are concatenated together to reduce the number of files and to reduce simulator compile time
 * Reducing the default transceiver DRPCLK frequency in the cores out-of-context XDC file from 200MHz to 125MHz.  This is the default frequency used when the core is synthesised in isolation, and is overridden when the core is implemented in a full design.

2014.3:
 * Version 12.1 (Rev. 3)
 * IBUF's have been added to the refclk_p and refclk_n inputs before the IBUFGTE2 primitive for all 7-Series devices.  These were previously inferred by the tools, so there is no change to overall logical functionality.  However, this does enable Vivado commands such as report_clock_networks to work correctly at all applicable Vivado stages
 * Updated to use the latest GT Ultrascale Wizard
 * Revised the Ultrascale reset logic to satisfy the minimum reset pulse width requirements for reset inputs of the Ultrascale GT Wizard instantiation
 * Revised the Ultrascale reset logic to assert the Rx reset to the core when the transceviers are placed in powerdown
 * For VHDL projects, all core VHDL files are now compiled into a core specific library (xaui_v12_3 for this core version) with the exception of the top level VHDL wrapper file for the core which remains in the default library (named xil_defaultlib unless overridden by the user).  This makes the core consistent with other Xilinx IP.  No changes to core instantiations are required in customer HDL files
 * Input port default tie-off values for IP Integrator have been added to signal_detect and removed from clock signals (which must be connected)
 * Fixed the example design to connect the output of the dclk BUFG clock buffer to the core (previously the dclk input was connected directly to the core)
 * The directory path to the UltraScale FPGAs Transceivers Wizard output products has been shortened

2014.2:
 * Version 12.1 (Rev. 2)
 * Updated to use the latest GT Ultrascale Wizard
 * Fixed an issue on the GUI symbol where the gt_dmonitorout ports did not appear in the transcevier_debug bus interfaces when targeting the GTHE2 and GTXE2 transceivers

2014.1:
 * Version 12.1 (Rev. 1)
 * Virtex UltraScale Pre-Production support
 * Fixed the operation of the mgt_rx_reset_inprocess signal (part of the GTPE2/GTHE2 reset logic)(see Xilinx Answer 59860)
 * Fixed GTPE2/GTHE2 reliability issues by ensuring that the GTPE2/GTHE2 cannot get permanently stuck in the wrong internal datawidth setting during reset cycles. (see Xilinx Answer 59861)
 * Fixed powerdown reliability issues by ensuring that the transceiver phase alignment state machine is reset when the powerdown state is removed. (see Xilinx Answer 59292)
 * Fixed the SIM_RESET_SPEEDUP attribute setting (now set to FALSE) for GTPE2 and GTHE2 transceivers, as per the 7-Series FPGAs Transceivers User Guides.  This is required in order to simulate correctly the transcevier reset/initialization sequence; this leads to longer reset/initialization simulation times.
 * Increased the clock domain crossing synchronizer flip-flop stages for 20 Gigabits per second operation.
 * Added missing XDC constraints on the MDIO signal inputs to ease timing closure (see Xilinx Answer 59912)
 * Added clock frequency metadata to the GT reference clocks for use in IPI only.
 * Updated the description in the Vivado IP cataglogue to state that the core can support 20 Gigabits per second operation.
 * Internal device family name change, no functional changes

2013.4:
 * Version 12.1
 * Kintex UltraScale Pre-Production support
 * Increased the number of optional transceiver control and status ports.
 * The mark_debug attribute was removed from all nets so that the Xilinx lab tools would not be prepopulated with an undesired configuration.

2013.3:
 * Version 12.0
 * Artix-7 and Zynq-7000 devices now supported at Production status
 * FBG packages enabled
 * Added support for upgrade from previous versions.
 * Added optional transceiver control and status ports support.
 * Added support for IP Integrator.
 * Fixed 7 Series GTP/GTH reset logic (see Xilinx Answer 56312).
 * Updated synchronizers to improve Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) for metastability.
 * clk156 is now always a core output (clk156_out) driven by a BUFG. This clock cannot be shared with other XAUI core instances due to the GT buffer bypass mechanism.
 * DRP ports are now only present if the additional transceiver control ports are enabled
 * Added support for the out of context flow.
 * Added GUI option to include or exclude shareable logic resources in the core. Please refer to the Product Guide for information and port changes.
 * Updated 7 Series GTH QPLL attributes (see Xilinx Answer 56332)

2013.2:
 * Version 11.0 (Rev. 1)
 * Fixed wrong set_false_path in XDC corresponding to AR 55226.
 * Fixed RX termination attributes for 7 series GTP and GTH (AR 55837).

2013.1:
 * Version 11.0
 * Zynq support.
 * Artix7 20G XAUI support.
 * The previous 'core block' level is now the top level of the core. This includes transicever instances. The transceiver instances and supporting logic are still delivered as plain HDL.
 * Hierarchical XDC.
 * Added support for the out-of-context flow
